I work currently on the synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held, a giant synapse in the central mammalian auditory pathway. Primarily, this synapse is a fast, inverting relay, which allows the binaural processing, for example for localization of sound source.
The exceptional calyx size permits the simultaneous pre and post synaptic patch clamp (electrophysiological) recording in brain slices. Therefore, this synapse is an excellent model to highlight basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission and properties of many other synapses in the nervous system.
The main purpose of my work is to better understand the energetic resources underlying the neuromodulation of the synaptic response, i.e. the balance between neuronal integration and metabolic cost for the brain.
To do that I use mathematical models able to reproduce computationally the synapse activity, allowing the biological hypothesis to be self consistent and so, to better understand the short term plasticity, in the central nervous system.
